Fri3d Camp 2016 Proposals
=========================

I'm Geert Fannes (geert.fannes@gmail.com), 38 years old, married and live in Zoersel with my 4 boys (11, 9, 7 and 7 years old). I'm a mathematician/engineer specialized in software development (mainly C++), machine learning and algorithm design, currently working for Auro Technologies where I design and develop audio encoders/decoders. I hosted a robotics club with a few former collegues for a few year and try to experiment with AI, robotics and autonomous aircrafts. Unfortunately, I struggle to find enough free time. Besides technology, I'm also very interested in gastronomics, both producing and consuming ends.

For Fri3d Camp 2016, I would like to work around 2 topics: building a trebuchet and creating an RC child.


## Trebuchet

### Trebuchets and physics

For starters, I would like to give a talk (dutch or english is fine for me) providing some overview of the history of these medieval throwing machines, the differrent types and the basic physics required to understand and design them. Optimally, I can find enough time to create a simulation program that can be used to show their workings and optimise them (throwing distance, efficiency).

30-60 min should be enough, a beamer would be nice. I gave a few talks before, but never on this topic.

### Trebuchet in action

No fun with theory alone. The goal of this workshop is to build an actual trebuchet (counterweight or floating-arm trebuchet) capable of throwing tennis balls. I already built a POC in my basement (2m high) that swings, but has no sling yet. The build is too lightweight, but most of the critical parts are tested and working.

I plan to bring along all required materials, tools and basic plans to the camp site, I estimate the build to take 3-4 hours with a few persons. Electricity is needed, a vise would be nice.

Since a trebuchet involves heavy weights, a swinging arm and flying objects, safety is a major concern. This build should involve enough adults and cannot be left unattended when kids are playing around.

I built a POC, did some other builds before, and plan to create version 2.0 before Fri3d Campp takes place. If only limited time is available during the camp, I can bring a prepared trebuchet along, but I think it will be more fun to build one from scratch.


## RC Child

### How to remote control a child

This workshop is targetted towards younger children, were they will learn the basics of RC and servo motors. The idea is to create a helmet (or box or whatever) that blocks vision completely. By installing two servo motors in the helmet with dials indicating front-back and left-right, one can control the helmet-bearer.

One helmet needs at least:
* Paper, cardboard, glue and tape for the helmet. Hot gluegun and ducktape seems ok.
* One battery, 7.4V is ok.
* One BEC to convert the 7.4V to 5V for the RC receiver and servo motors.
* One RC transmitter.
Optionally, more advanced dials might require an arduino, some LEDs etc.

I have material for one helmet at home. It seems simple enough to create, but I did not test this idea yet. I think 60min is enough to explain the basics of RC to children, create the helmet, integrate the electronics and test it.

Some safety should be taken into account: no cardboard tubes should be used close to the eyes since those can cause damage during a fall. Next to this, the helmet should be big enough to allow focus on the dials, and some way to let in light.

If we have a few helmets, a race seems like a must.


## General assistence

I plan to bring along my 4 kids, and maybe my brother (similar genes, similar skills and interests). Apart from watching over them, I am available where needed (other workshops, cooking, ...).

Greetings, Geert.
